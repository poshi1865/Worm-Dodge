Worm dodge is a game where you are a worm trapped in a box with a bunch of balls. You have to try to NOT EAT the balls.
Everytime you eat a ball, your movement speed and length increases, and this goes on till you hit a wall and die. The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible.

This game is written from scratch in Java using the swing library.
